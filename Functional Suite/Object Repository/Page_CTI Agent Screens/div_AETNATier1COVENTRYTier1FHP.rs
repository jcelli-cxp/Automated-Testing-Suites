COACHINGIf you are asked, &quot;Can you answer questions about Medicare Part C/D?&quot;- Answer &quot;Yes&quot;

SECRET SHOPPER Q &amp; A TALKING POINTS1. Use &quot;Ctrl F&quot; to search Q &amp; A Document for questions.- These are the EXACT answers that CMS needs to hear. - Never use your own words or your own skills to find the answer.- Look up the answer on the Q &amp; A document and read it to the caller WORD for WORD2. Often the caller will need the language line or TTY Services.A. Language LineYou will recognize these calls, because they often start with the caller saying the name of a language, such as:a. &quot;Mandarin&quot;b. &quot;Tagalog&quot; (this is the Philippine language: pronounced: &quot;Ta-gol-og&quot;)c. &quot;Spanish&quot;d. &quot;Cantonese&quot;1. Tell the caller: &quot;One moment while I get a translator&quot;2. Put the caller on hold, call the language line3. Select the language the caller needs 4. Wait until the translator comes on 5. Take your caller off hold and bring them on to the line with you and the translator 6. YOU MUST STAY ON THE CALL with the translator and the caller7. Perform the call as you normally would, working through the call in &quot;sound bites&quot;. The translator will translate yourwords to the caller, and the caller’s words to you B. TTY ServicesYou will recognize these calls as they start with the caller (usually the TTY operator) introducing themselves and sayingthey have someone on the line who is hard of hearing and who needs a “relay service”a. They often ask if you have taken a relay call before. Answer honestly.b. If you haven’t taken a relay call, they may briefly run you through what to doc. Answer operator’s questions as to your name etc.d. When the caller is on the line, the first thing they will likely ask is: &quot;Can you answer questions about Part D (or C)?&quot;- Say: “Yes, I can answer questions about Part D [or C]”e. Speak in “sound bites” so that the TTY operator has time to accurately type what you are saying to the hearingimpaired person on the line.f. Look up all information in your Q &amp; A document and read the answer word for word. Use Control F to search theQ &amp; A document
